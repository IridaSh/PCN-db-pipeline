# PCN-db-pipeline
## Requirements: biopython, kallisto, SRA-Toolkit, pysradb, and ncbi-datasets-cli

### This program can either be run on your Desktop or Duke Compute Cluster (DCC). DCC is suggested to use due to the large amount of data that is downloaded from the thousands of samples. 
### The files needed to run the program with are found in the data folder (ncbidataset_assembly and ncbidataset_refseq). The data from these files were obtained by downloading a list of all sequenced baterial genome from https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/datasets/genome/?taxon=2&assembly_level=3%3A3. The ref seq and assembly ID columns were isolated.
